title: "Binary Search That Helps in Real Life"

When a tool fails, you can lose an entire day debugging it. But the cause is often surprisingly simple. Can we save time with a little math? Use binary search. You can find the culprit in <comp.OLogN /> time.

## [Git Bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect)

When working with git, [atomic commits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit) are helpful because you can use `git bisect`.

I once fixed a bug where the menu order got shuffled ([PR](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/pull/2823)). With binary search, I found the culprit in 30 minutes. Changing a `vector` to a `set` caused it. I wasted time asking GPT because there were too many commits. Smaller commits would have helped.

## [VSCode Extension Bisect](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/02/16/extension-bisect)

Since the previous day, the input box overlapped every time I typed Korean. I rebooted and tried different IMEs, but nothing worked. Then I remembered VSCode can bisect extensions.

The culprit was the last extension I installed, which conflicted with the IME. Removing it fixed the issue.
